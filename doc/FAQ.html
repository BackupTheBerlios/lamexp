<h3>LameXP - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3><br>

<b>What is LameXP ???</b><br>
<br>
LameXP is a graphical user-interface for a number of audio encoders. It was developed to support a huge<br>
number of input formats. File formats are detected reliably using MediaInfo. Compressed audio formats are<br>
decoded to uncompressed Wave files using suitable CLI audio decoders. Furthermore LameXP allows batch<br>
processing of multiple audio files. Multithreading is implemented by processing several audio files<br>
concurrently. All the third-party tools incorporated in LameXP are listed in the "About" dialog. The Nero AAC<br>
encoder cannot be redistribited due to licensing issues; it is availabel as a free download from the public<br>
Nero web-site. Note: LameXP does NOT use/need any "external" audio decoders. It neither requires nor supports<br>
any ACM Codecs or DirectShow/DMO filters! And it will NOT install anything of that kind on your system.<br><br>

<br><br>

<b>My anti-virus program raises an alarm when I try to download/install/launch LameXP. Why is that?</b><br>
<br>
Occasionally your anti-virus program may mistakenly detect "malware"  (virus, trojan, worm, etc.) in some of<br>
the files here. This is called a "false-positive" and the files are actually innocent/clean. It's an error in<br>
your specific anti-virus software. In case you encounter such problems, goto <a href="http://www.virustotal.com/" target="_blank">http://www.virustotal.com/</a> and<br>
check the file with multiple anti-virus engines! Moreover take care with results like "suspicious", "generic"<br>
or "packed". Those are *not* real malware detections, they are just wild speculation.<br>
<br>
Apparently anti-virus programs tend to suspect installers/uninstaller created with NSIS. Furthermore some<br>
anti-virus programs blindly suspect all UPX'd (packed) executables of being malware. Obviously this is a<br>
stupid generalization, so please ignore those warnings! Last but not least: Always keep in mind that this is<br>
OpenSource software. If you don't trust the people providing the pre-compiled binaries, download the source<br>
code, search the code for "malicious" functions (good luck ^^) and compile your own binary.<br>
<br>
DON'T SUBMIT ANY VIRUS REPORTS, UNLESS YOU HAVE VERIFIED THE INFECTION WITH MULTIPLE ANTI-VIRUS ENGNINES!<br><br>

<br><br>

<b>Who created LameXP?</b><br>
<br>
LameXP was written from the scratch by LoRd_MuldeR &lt;MuldeR2@GMX.de&gt;. However it has to be noted that LameXP<br>
uses a number of thrird-party tools, which have been created by the individual authors. Moreover various<br>
people have contributed LameXP translations. Please see the "About" dialog for details!<br><br>

<br><br>

<b>What license is LameXP released under?</b><br>
<br>
LameXP is free software. You can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public<br>
License (GPL) as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your<br>
option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY<br>
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.<br>
<br>
Please see the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target="_blank">GNU General Public License</a> for more details!<br><br>

<br><br>

<b>How can I use LameXP as a "portable" application?</b><br>
<br>
LameXP always is "portable", in the sense that the application works out of the box: LameXP does NOT require<br>
any additional software, such as codecs, encoders, decoders or runtime libraries, and it will NOT install<br>
anything of that kind on your local computer! All the third-party tools used by LameXP are already built-in.<br>
There currently are two notable exceptions: The Nero AAC encoder and the WMA decoder cannot be redistributed<br>
along with LameXP for legal reasons. Therefore these tools have to be obtained as separate downloads.<br>
<br>
Having said that, LameXP stores its configuration file in the %LOCALAPPDATA% folder on the local computer.<br>
That's because on a modern multi-user operating this is the only "correct" folder to store user-specific<br>
configuration files. Also it's one of the few folders where an application is guaranteed to get write-access,<br>
even when the application was launched by a "normal" (non-admin) user and did not request elevated rights.<br>
Storing the configuration file in the "install" folder is antiquated and highly error-prone.<br>
<br>
Still some users may want to store the configuration file in the same folder as the LameXP execuatble file,<br>
e.g. when launching LameXP directly from their USB stick on different computers. For this purpose LameXP now<br>
offers a "true" portable mode. You can enable that mode simply by renaming the LameXP executable file to<br>
"LameXP-Portable.exe". But be aware: When running LameXP in the "portable" mode, the user(!) must ensure that<br>
write-access is granted to the directory where the LameXP exectable is located.<br><br>

<br><br>

<b>The LameXP startup (splash screen) takes very long on my system. What can I do?</b><br>
<br>
Starting up LameXP shouldn't take longer than approximately 10 seconds. However it was brought to our<br>
attention that badly optimized anti-virus software can slow down the startup procedure a lot! On our test<br>
system (Windows 7 running on an Intel Core2 Q6600 with 4 GB of RAM) starting up LameXP takes about 3 seconds<br>
without an anti-virus software and about 6 seconds with the "real-time protection" of Micorosft Security<br>
Essentials enabled. With other anti-virus software the startup was delayed up to 20 seconds and more!<br>
<br>
So if you think that LameXP is starting up too slow on your system, you should temporarily(!) disable or<br>
uninstall your current anti-virus program and try again. Usually it should be sufficient to disable only the<br>
"real-time protection", "file system protection" or "guard" feature of your anti-virus software. If it turns<br>
out that the startup is signficanntly(!) faster WITHOUT the anti-virus software, please report the problem to<br>
the developer of the anti-virus software. And, if they don't fix the problem, switch to a better product!<br><br>

<br><br>

<b>How can I translate LameXP to my language or improve an existing translation?</b><br>

<br><br>

<b>What are the prerequisites to build LameXP from the sources?</b><br>
<br>
LameXP is currently being developed using the following build environment:<br><ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2008, Service Pack 1
<li>Qt libraries v4.7.1 for Windows (VS 2008)
<li>Microsoft Windows SDK v7.1</ul>
<br>
Also note the following hints:<br><ul>
<li>You must launch Visual Studio using "qtvars.bat vsstart" in order to enable the Qt tools
<li>The Microsoft Windows SDK v6.0A should work as well, with a few limitations
<li>In order to make a fully "static" build of LameXP, you need to compile Qt as static libraries
<li>Support for the GNU Toolchain (GCC/MinGW + Make) is planned for a future version</ul>
